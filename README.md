# Book-Music-Recommendation-System

 📚🎵 Book Music Recommendation System (SQL Project)
Welcome to the **Book Music Recommendation System** SQL project! This project focuses on enhancing the reading experience by providing music recommendations based on the mood of your book. For example, if you’re reading a romantic novel, the system will suggest soft, romantic songs to complement your reading.

🎯 Project Overview
This project aims to create a database-driven system where users can receive music recommendations that align with the genre or mood of the book they read. The SQL database stores information about various books and corresponding music tracks that match their mood.
